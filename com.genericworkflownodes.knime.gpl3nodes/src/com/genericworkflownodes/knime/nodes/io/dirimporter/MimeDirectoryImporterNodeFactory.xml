            With this node you can locate files in a folder (and optionally in all of its subfolders)
            on your file system that can serve as input for other Generic KNIME Nodes. This is different
            from "Remote Folder", in the sense that it only supports import of files of the same MIME-type
            and writes them directly to URI Ports. You can also specify regular expressions or wildcards
            that filter the found files by their filename (without extension).
            </p>

        <option name="Directory">
            Specifies the path to the directory to list. Can read KNIME relative paths and use
            flow variables (button on the right).
        </option>
        <option name="Recursive">
            Additionally traverses subfolders and lists all matching files. Folders never match.
        </option>
        <option name="Extension">
		  Required. To unify the MIME-type of the output URIs, a file extension has to be provided
          that enables a first filtering step by file extension.
        </option>
        <option name="Filter Expression">
          An optional filter expression to filter the found files of the specified type before
          listing them. Can be disabled (none), a wildcard or a regular expression.
        </option>
