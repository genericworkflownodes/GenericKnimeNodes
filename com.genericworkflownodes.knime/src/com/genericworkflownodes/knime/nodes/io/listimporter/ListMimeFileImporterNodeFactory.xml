    <fullDescription>
          <intro>With this node you can locate a set of files on your file system that can serve as input
         for another Generic Knime Node. This is different from "File Reader", in the sense that
          the files are not read into an internal KNIME Table, but stay on your file system.</intro>
    
    
    <option name="Selected Files">
             The list of full names (including its directory) of the files. 
             All the files should be of the same file type.
         </option>
       <option name="File extension (override)">
		By default, Input Files will determine the file type by the extension of the files, but 
		this behavior can be overridden (e.g. in case of a custom file extension but known file type).
		In that case, you can provide the extension for the file type you want the files to be interpreted as.
