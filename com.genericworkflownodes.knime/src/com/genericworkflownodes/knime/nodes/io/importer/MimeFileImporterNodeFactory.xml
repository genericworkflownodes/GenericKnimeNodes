	        <p>
				With this node you can locate a file on your file system (i.e., file:// and executor-local knime:// protocol paths)
				that can serve as input for another Generic KNIME Node. This is different from "File Reader", in the sense that
				the files are not read into an internal KNIME Table, but stay on your file system. Note: On a KNIME server you might
				need to enable access to the server's file system.

        <option name="Selected file">
             Specifies the full name (including its directory) of the file.
        </option>
     	<option name="File extension (override)">
			By default, Input File will determine the file type by the extension of the file, but 
			this behavior can be overridden (e.g. in case of a custom file extension but known file type).
			In that case, you can provide the extension for the file type you want the file to be interpreted as.
