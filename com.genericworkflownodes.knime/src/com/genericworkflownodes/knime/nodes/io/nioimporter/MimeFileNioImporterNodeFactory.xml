        Locate and potentially import one or multiple files from a file system which

	<intro>
        <p>
		  With this node you can locate and potentially import one or multiple files on any file system that can serve as input
          for another Generic KNIME Node. This is different from the KNIME "File Reader", in the sense that
          the file is not read into an internal KNIME Table, but stays on your file system.
          For non-local files (i.e., everything except for Local and workflow-relative files)
          the file is first copied into the workflow data area. The files will be deleted on
          a reset of the node. Therefore, if you want to save the workflow with the input data, make sure
          not to reset the inputs. If you need a more persistent solution, use KNIME's File Transfer node

	</intro>
	<option name="Read from">
			Select a file system which stores the files/folders you want to list. There are
			three default file system options to choose from:
			<br />
			<ul>
                <li><i>Local File System:</i> Allows you to select a folder from your
                    local system.
                </li>
                <li><i>Mountpoint:</i> Allows you to read from a mountpoint.
                	When selected, a new drop-down menu appears to choose the mountpoint.
                	Unconnected mountpoints are greyed out but can still be selected (note that browsing is disabled in this case).
                	Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable browsing.
                	A mountpoint is displayed in red if it was previously selected but is no longer available.
                	You won't be able to save the dialog as long as you don't select a valid i.e. known mountpoint.
                </li>
                <li><i>Relative to:</i> Allows you to choose whether to resolve the path
					relative to the current mountpoint, current workflow or the current workflow's data area.
                When selected a new drop-down menu appears to choose which of the three options to use.
                </li>
			</ul>
			To import files from other file systems, click on
            <b>...</b> in the bottom left corner of the node icon followed by
            <i>Add File System Connection port</i>. Afterwards, connect the desired file system connector
            node to the newly added input port.
            The file system connection will then be shown in the drop-down menu.
            It is greyed out if the file system is not connected in which case you have to (re)execute the connector node first.
			Note: The default file systems listed above can't be selected if a file system is provided via the input port.
		</option>
		<option name="Mode">
			There are three different file/folder listing modes available:
			<ul>
				<li><i>File:</i> Import a single file.</li>
				<li><i>Files in folder:</i> Import multiple files from a folder according to a set of filter options.</li>
			</ul>
		</option>
		<option name="Filter options">
			Allows to specify which files/folders should be included according to their file extension and/or name.
			It is also possible to include hidden files/folders.
		</option>
		<option name="Include subfolders">
			If this option is checked, the node will include all files/folders from subfolders that satisfy the specified filter options.
			If left unchecked, only the files/folders in the selected folder will be included and all files/folders from subfolders are ignored.
		</option>
		
		
		<option name="Folder">
			Allows you to specify the folder whose contents should be listed. The
			required syntax of a path depends on the chosen file system, such as &quot;C:\path\to\file&quot; (Local
			File System on Windows) or  &quot;/path/to/file&quot; (Local
            File System on Linux/MacOS and Mountpoint). For file systems connected via input port, the node
            description of the respective connector node describes the required path format.
			You can also choose a previously selected folder from the drop-down list, or select a location
			from the &quot;Browse...&quot; dialog.
			Note that browsing is disabled in some cases:
			<ul>
				<li><i>Mountpoint:</i> Browsing is disabled if the selected mountpoint isn't connected.
				Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable browsing.</li>
				<li><i>File systems provided via input port:</i>
				Browsing is disabled if the connector node hasn't been executed since the workflow has been opened.
				(Re)execute the connector node to enable browsing.</li>
			</ul>
               <i>The location can be exposed as or automatically set via a 
               </i><a href="https://docs.knime.com/latest/analytics_platform_file_handling_guide/index.html#path">
               <i>path flow variable.</i></a>
		</option>
    
        <option name="File extension (override)">
		  By default, the importer will determine the file type by the extension of the file, but 
		  this behavior can be overridden (e.g., in case of a custom file extension but known file type).
		  In that case, you can provide the extension for the file type you want the file to be interpreted as.
		  This is important because the connectability with other nodes depends on the file type.
